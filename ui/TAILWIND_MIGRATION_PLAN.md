# Tailwind CSS Migration Plan

This document outlines the plan for fully migrating from styled-components to Tailwind CSS.

## Completed Work

1. ✅ Set up Tailwind CSS with the proper configuration
2. ✅ Convert global CSS to use Tailwind's utility classes
3. ✅ Migrate the following styled components to Tailwind:
   - Button
   - Title1
   - Title2
   - LoadButton
   - MessageBox
   - Form
   - Foot
   - Input
   - Label
   - LastUpdated
   - Meta
   - Query
   - Tag
   - Tags

## Next Steps

1. Continue replacing the remaining styled components with Tailwind:
   - Update any components in the `styled` directory that weren't converted
   - Identify inline styled components created within the component files

2. Replace styled-components usage in actual components:
   - Identify all components currently using styled-components
   - Replace with direct use of Tailwind classes
   - Gradually reduce dependency on the styled-components library

3. Refactor parent components:
   - Update parent components to pass appropriate Tailwind classes to child components
   - Fix any styling issues that arise during migration

4. Create a Tailwind utility component library:
   - Create reusable Tailwind components for common UI elements
   - Document the new component library for future development

5. Remove styled-components:
   - Once all components have been migrated, remove styled-components from dependencies
   - Update any imports or remaining uses of styled-components

## Migration Best Practices

1. **One component at a time**: Convert components individually to ensure proper functionality
2. **Use className prop**: Ensure all components accept a className prop for extensibility
3. **Test thoroughly**: Test each component after conversion
4. **Maintain consistency**: Keep design consistent during the transition
5. **Document changes**: Keep documentation updated as components are migrated

## Styling Guidelines with Tailwind

1. Use Tailwind's utility classes directly in JSX for most styling needs
2. For complex styling, create Tailwind component classes in the CSS file
3. Use the `@apply` directive for complex hover/focus states if needed
4. Leverage Tailwind's color variables for consistent theming
